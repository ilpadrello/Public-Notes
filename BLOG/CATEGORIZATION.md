I think one of the most important thing to know in modern software development is: "how to categorize"...

Let's think about it for a second: When developing a database, you can choose to create schemas to separate logic buisness(crm.users, hr.users, staff.users), or better understand easly the database structure and relationships (lookup.user, fact.user_phone_numer).

Another example could be folder structure in a software project. tool, utils or lib?, class or model ?, schemas, controller or middleware ?, app, core ? dist or public ?....there are ton of example of ways to categorizes files.

Of course all of this is just a way to better categorize stuff, the application would work the same even all files where in just a folder (not for dist/ pub tbh).

And like this there are example everywhere, and I have my 2cent about this issue: 

## DO NOT OVERTHINK !

I know, you want to do good, you want to show people your code and let them know that you know your stuff ! That your are not an ape smashing a keyboard, you put effort and passion in your code. You have spent TIME and ENERGY thinking about how to categorize things, like a 3D printed organizer tailed for you "drawer software". It is important for us.
But let's have a real talk: categorize  stuff is important, OVER DO IT is not !
Let's take for example the dist/public enigma... dist is for the backend? public is just for the front end ? It doesn't matter... Important thing is that IS EXPOSED TO THE WORLD.

Or the tool, utils, libs problem: what are the differences between those ? 
Ok, libs could be indipendent library that we use in our code, no wait those are usually modules (like node modules). So lib are like code that we wrote that we can reuse in all the code: YEAH ! 
Only that this is true for 99% of the code we make.

So, utils could be building scripts, migrations, they are utils for sure! I mean a migration is not a lib!
What do you mean, you made a lib for handling migrations ? So they go migration NOW ????
What the hell ??? 

A lib for handling migrations is more a tool or a lib ?

See what I mean ?

## WHY DO WE CATOGORIZE ?

Why do we categorize stuff ?
Usually, we group stuff that have some attribute in common, but why? We do it to get an easy access to the things.

We put fork, knives, spoons all together because we know that we will use them at the same moment. We know that if we need a fork, we will probably need a knife as well, so we put those together.

If its so easy, why it feels difficult sometimes to categorize stuff ?

## BECAUSE THE OVERLAPPING CATEGORIES

This is exactly why !
Ok, we want all the stuff well separated, all the knives are in that drawer, all of them ! 
No wait, those knives are for the barbeque, those should be used only in the barbeque, I will have to go to the kitchen each time I need one of those... But that knife in particular, that is for both! 
Oh no, what do I do now ???? How do I solve this riddle ?

Overlapping categories are the hell for us overthinker categorizers. And that is where the problem lies.

## THE ONLY QUESTION WE SHOULD ASK
 To answer my categorization riddle, I think the best solution is asking the correct questions, and the correct questions are : 
### HOW MUCH TIME AND EFFORT WILL TAKE ME TO RECATEGORIZE THINGS WHEN I NEED THOSE?
Let's imagine that I need to make some update a the logger class, oh wait, where is it ?
Ok, following my own (and only mine) rule, it should be in the utils, since is something usefull...
No wait, I made it so that it could be reused in another software I make, that is definitevly in the libs... SO WHY IS IN THE TOOL FOLDER ??? 

If you take MORE time to find something, that you take if you put in a single folder, than you should do that ! 
Usually that happens when the line of the group you want to categorize are blurry in your head, while it is easy for the socks drawer, the are socks, how blurry that line can be ?

### CAN I CATEGORIZE IT LATER ?
This is more evident, and important if you can categorize stuff later.
Sometimes group patterns can appear to us later, when we have a full drawer.
We start to see that we can easily categorize stuff because we see a pattern.

So, if we can do it later, DO IT LATER ! 

With that said, here's some categorization p\*rn for you my OCD friend: 

### **1. Hierarchical Categorization (Tree Structure)**

- **Concept:** Organizing items in a **parent-child** structure.
- **Example (Folders):**
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `/Projects   ├── Web   │   ├── Frontend   │   ├── Backend   ├── Mobile   │   ├── Android   │   ├── iOS`
    
- **Example (Database Schemas):**
    - `finance.invoices`
    - `finance.payments`
    - `hr.employees`
    - `hr.payroll`
- **Best For:** Clear, structured relationships where each item belongs to one category.

---

### **2. Functional Categorization**

- **Concept:** Organizing based on purpose or function.
- **Example (Folders):**
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `/Design /Development /Testing /Deployment`
    
- **Example (Database Schemas):**
    - `auth.users`
    - `log.errors`
    - `analytics.reports`
- **Best For:** Systems where different teams or responsibilities need separation.

---

### **3. Object-Oriented Categorization**

- **Concept:** Grouping based on the **type of object** instead of function.
- **Example (Folders):**
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `/Users /Products /Orders`
    
- **Example (Database Schemas):**
    - `users.accounts`
    - `products.inventory`
    - `orders.transactions`
- **Best For:** Systems that deal with distinct types of entities.

---

### **4. Process-Based Categorization**

- **Concept:** Organizing based on workflow steps.
- **Example (Folders):**
    
    css
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `/Input /Processing /Output`
    
- **Example (Database Schemas):**
    - `raw_data.imports`
    - `processing.jobs`
    - `output.reports`
- **Best For:** ETL pipelines, workflows, automation systems.

---

### **5. Layer-Based Categorization (Software Architecture)**

- **Concept:** Separating by system layers (like in MVC, microservices).
- **Example (Folders):**
    
    pgsql
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `/API /Database /Frontend`
    
- **Example (Database Schemas):**
    - `core.users`
    - `transactions.orders`
    - `logs.errors`
- **Best For:** Microservices, clean software architecture.

---

### **6. Industry-Specific Categorization**

- **Concept:** Grouping based on domain-specific logic.
- **Example (Folders - Medical Industry):**
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `/Patients /Doctors /Appointments`
    
- **Example (Database Schemas - E-commerce):**
    - `customers.accounts`
    - `inventory.products`
    - `sales.orders`
- **Best For:** Domain-driven design (DDD).
