Redis is an open-source, advanced key-value store and an apt solution for building high-performance, scalable web applications.

Redis has three main peculiarities that set it apart.

- Redis holds its database entirely in the memory, using the disk only for persistence.

- Redis has a relatively rich set of data types when compared to many key-value data stores.

- Redis can replicate data to any number of slaves.
