# JSON WEB TOKEN

The JSON Web Token is a great and useful tool to use in an API environment! A JWT is like a bracelet that you wear after paying the entrance in a place, with the big difference that this "bracelet" can not be altered because it uses the Private/Public key exchange!

## "NPM install jsonwebtoken"

The easiest way of working with JTW is by installing the package "jsonwebtoken" ("npm install jsonwebtoken")
