## JSON OR YAML
The OpenAPI specification is written in .json or .yml files

## TOOL ADVANTAGE
Using and creating with OpenAPI standard means that you can use all the tools that exists to make everything easy, moked server, API validation, even an automatic documentation.
## Two approaches
There are two approach on how to write API:

### Code first, description later
First you create the code, then you try to fit the code into the OpenAPI specs. Usually this do not work since OpenAPI is less capable than the code itself.

### Description first, code later
This approach make sure that you can create a described version of the API, more futureproof.
