In the first part it discuss the epidemy of obesity. 
This is interesting for different reasons : It explain how and why big companies put they interests before health of the people, they even promote and finance studies that are not correct and try to falsify studies that go against them.

Also lobbing (America's national sport) is also a very lucrative way to pass legislations in favor of the big companies.

The food industries blames inactivity: "if only our customers did more exercize", but they do not say that their food has increased 50% cal/gram more than before.
Also exercise is not the answer, as some studies shows : At the beginning of your diet, more exercise helps with weight loss, but soon the body will compensate this work you do exercising with some fatigue that let you rest more and compensate the exercise.

It is show that the difference between a person that exercise, and a person that doesn't is about an apple in kcal.
Does that means that you shouldn't exercise ? Absolutely not, even if you use kcal that you thought, there are more advantages to the exercise for your health that should not be ignored.

### THE FIRST CAUSE
The first cause could easily be technology and food abundance.
Since 1970 the food industries got a technology glow up that let them produce way more food that we need. And they don't want you to eat less, they don't care, you must eat all the food that they produces.

### PORTIONS
How do you do that ? Well starting with BIGGER PORTIONS.
The average American cinema popcorn bucket has an increased size of 150 to 500 % from the 80's.
They Pack more food together so that you must buy all of them.

People are also prone to go to restaurants that offers bigger portions, since you have the impression that you have more value for the similar amount of money.

### GENETICS
Are our genes important for the weight ? Are we fat because the "fat gene" run in our family ?
The answer is No! Genes do not have any important impact in the matter.

It is proven that a "fat" surrogate mother eating during pregnancy of a "slim" genetical mother have more chance to be fat. The way the mother eat during pregnancy is more important than the gene of the child.

### SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST
If there isn't something important about gene, there is about our evolution as an animal specie.
Our brain evolved in a way that make us eat more : The mechanism that "store" our eaten energy is essential for survival and we didn't develop a limit for this, so obesity is a "normal reaction for an abnormal environment"

It makes sense for the prehistorical humans to no try to eat food that was not worthy: it is illogical to eat a food that give us less Cal than a we spend to get it, and this is why we usually do not preferer eat vegetables. 

If you study the food preferences of a 4/5 y.o. child they prefer bananas over berries, carrots over cucumbers etc. Is that a preference for sweetness ? No they also prefer potato over peaches and green bean over melon. It is an inborn drive to maximize calories per mouthful.

In the years we developed a "sense" for the number of calories that a food could give us, we are able to understand if an apple give us more energy than a piece o paper.
Unfortunately this sense do not work with food that has A LOT of calories
### WE OVEREAT CALORIES NOT FOOD (FOOD BOMBS MADE OF C.R.A.P.)

The Food industries exploit this innate biological vulnerability, by removing everything that has "less" cal per gram and creating food that is C.R.A.P. food (Calories Rich And Processed food) so caloric dense that are caloric bombs.
Our brain is vulnerable to this approach, it is a bug in our system.

### DRIVEN BY DISTRACTION (EAT MORE MARKETING)
Of course we eat more when we are distracted, and that is why we are bombarded with images of food-bombs that unconsciously make us salivate (especially when you are addicted to food) and make us hungry.
And we spend more when hungry.

A study found that, putting French music in a wine part of the supermarket increased the sell of French wine, while putting German music increased the sells of German Wine... yes we are that easily influenced.

### IS FAT SHAMY IS OK ?
Apparently we are wired to be "racist" towards fat people, even child prefer amputated or disfigured people against fat people (at beauty level).
Apparently a "light delicate and kind stigmatization" can be helpful in the weight loss while living discrimination and bullying leads to more difficulties in maintaining a weight loss. People who suffers from "fat" discrimination are more likely not to seek help, and not exercise in public.

## DEFINE EXCESS BODY FAT

### BMI vs Body Fat Percentage
Most studies use BMI (Body Mass Index), the problem is that the BMI do not take to account the "composition" of the body: a body builder could have the same BMU of an Obese person.
The gold-standard measure of obesity is the percentage of body fat, but calculation for this can be complicated and expensive.

### KEEP YOUR WAIST LESS THAN HALF OF YOUR HEIGHT
While BMI doesn't consider the "composition" of the body the waist-to-height ratio is a better predictor of the body fat. 

### VISCERAL FAT IS THE DANGER
People that goes under liposuction do not get any health benefit from it.
That suggest the real fat that causes problem is not from the under the skin fat but from the visceral fat that is around our organs or even inside, for example muscle and liver.
And unfortunately to remove that fat, only the "fewer" calories diet is successful.
